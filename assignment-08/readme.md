What is an affordance?

I found a good description of what an affordance is on this blog "https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/affordances-web-design". They describe it like this: "Affordances are clues about how an object should be used, typically provided by the object itself or its context. For example, even if you’ve never seen a coffee mug before, its use is fairly natural. The handle is shaped for easy grasping and the vessel has a large opening at the top with an empty well inside. The object “affords” being picked up, meaning that it is able to be picked up. It also affords drinking out of. These are the things it’s designed to do, and that’s also what it looks like it’s designed to do."

Advantages of using a third-party service like YouTube or Vimeo are that it is most likely a much fast load-time to watch those videos because they have so much more infrastructure backing them up in comparison to an independent or smaller-scale service. A disadvantage of using a third-party service like YouTube or Vimeo is that if there are ever issues with those sites, that would create user-problems on my site too, potentially.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week with this assignment? How did you overcome them?

Well, it seems like I face some sort of challenge every week, lol! But this time in particular, it was when we were trying to figure out how to link instagram into my website. There was div fighting div and it just wasn't going to work! So, I decided to link a YouTube video instead.
