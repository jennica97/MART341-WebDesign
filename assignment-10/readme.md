Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

If you think of these selector types as cascading folder tiers, you could imagine how one might affect the other. Universal affects the whole page. The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type and you would use this when you want to change the style of individual elements on a page. The class selector is helpful for when you want to change individual elements across multiple pages. The ID selector is helpful for when you want to change single item styles. For example, I used the ID selector when trying to make my necklace display an image in a different dimension than the rest of the images below it on my homepage, I also used to add a border around my floating logo/homepage button on the top left. The ID selector, in this case, affected the border on the image across all my pages, but only that single image. It was super helpful!

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?

I chose the color palette based on the fact that I am from a beach town and my jewelry (that this website is promoting) is often inspired by the ocean. Teal blue and a sand color compliment these ideas!

Optional: discuss any challenges you faced this week, and how you overcame them.

It was funny, while I was trying to re-style my contact page, I ran into some issues trying to figure out why the list elements were being displayed as hyperlinks... then I talked it through and found I had weird extra brackets where I didnâ€™t need them to be. A silly mistake, but easily fixable.

Thanks, Ash! :)
